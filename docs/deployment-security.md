# Security Considerations for PLC Sniffer

## Overview

The PLC Sniffer operates with elevated network privileges to capture packets. This document outlines security considerations and best practices for deployment.

## Threat Model

### Potential Threats

1. **Unauthorized Access**
   - Risk: Attacker gains access to captured network traffic
   - Mitigation: Network isolation, access controls

2. **Amplification Attacks**
   - Risk: Tool used to amplify DoS attacks
   - Mitigation: Rate limiting, packet size limits

3. **Data Exfiltration**
   - Risk: Sensitive PLC data forwarded to unauthorized destination
   - Mitigation: Destination validation, network policies

4. **Resource Exhaustion**
   - Risk: Memory/CPU exhaustion from packet storms
   - Mitigation: Rate limiting, resource limits

5. **Privilege Escalation**
   - Risk: Container escape due to privileged mode
   - Mitigation: Use capabilities instead of privileged mode

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections

1. **Input Validation**
   - All configuration validated before use
   - IP addresses, ports, and filters sanitized
   - Protection against injection attacks

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Configurable packets-per-second limit
   - Token bucket algorithm prevents bursts
   - Protects against flooding attacks

3. **Packet Size Limits**
   - Maximum packet size validation
   - Prevents memory exhaustion
   - Default: 65535 bytes (UDP maximum)

4. **Non-Root Execution**
   - Runs as non-root user in container
   - Uses Linux capabilities instead of root
   - Minimal privilege principle

5. **Resource Limits**
   - Docker resource constraints
   - Memory and CPU limits
   - Prevents resource exhaustion

## Deployment Security

### Network Isolation

```yaml
# Example: Isolated network deployment
services:
  plc_sniffer:
    image: plc-sniffer:secure
    networks:
      - plc_network
      - monitoring_network
    cap_add:
      - NET_RAW
      - NET_ADMIN

networks:
  plc_network:
    internal: true
  monitoring_network:
    internal: true
```

### Firewall Rules

```bash
# Allow only specific destinations
iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp -d 192.168.1.100 --dport 514 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp -j DROP

# Rate limit at kernel level
iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp -m limit --limit 1000/second -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp -j DROP
```

### Access Controls

1. **File Permissions**
   ```bash
   chmod 750 /app
   chown -R sniffer:sniffer /app
   ```

2. **Container User**
   ```dockerfile
   USER 1000:1000  # Non-root user
   ```

3. **Capabilities**
   ```yaml
   cap_add:
     - NET_RAW      # Packet capture
     - NET_ADMIN    # Interface management
   cap_drop:
     - ALL          # Drop all other capabilities
   ```

## Operational Security

### Logging and Monitoring

1. **Security Events to Monitor**
   - Rate limit violations
   - Oversized packets
   - Configuration changes
   - Socket errors
   - Authentication failures (if implemented)

2. **Log Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Monitor for rate limiting
   grep "rate limit" /var/log/plc-sniffer.log
   
   # Check for errors
   grep -E "ERROR|CRITICAL" /var/log/plc-sniffer.log
   
   # Packet statistics
   curl http://localhost:8080/metrics | grep plc_sniffer
   ```

3. **Alerting Rules**
   ```yaml
   # Prometheus alert example
   - alert: HighPacketDropRate
     expr: rate(plc_sniffer_packets_dropped_total[5m]) > 100
     annotations:
       summary: "High packet drop rate detected"
   ```

### Secure Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never hardcode sensitive values
   - Use secrets management
   - Rotate credentials regularly

2. **Docker Secrets**
   ```yaml
   services:
     plc_sniffer:
       environment:
         - DESTINATION_IP_FILE=/run/secrets/dest_ip
       secrets:
         - dest_ip
   
   secrets:
     dest_ip:
       external: true
   ```

3. **Configuration Validation**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Fail securely on errors
   - Log configuration issues

## Compliance Considerations

### Industrial Security Standards

1. **IEC 62443** - Industrial network security
   - Network segmentation
   - Access control
   - Monitoring and logging

2. **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**
   - Identify assets
   - Protect with controls
   - Detect anomalies
   - Respond to incidents
   - Recover from events

### Data Protection

1. **PLC Data Sensitivity**
   - May contain process data
   - Could reveal operational patterns
   - Potential safety implications

2. **Data Handling**
   - Encrypt in transit (future feature)
   - Limit retention
   - Access controls on logs

## Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Packet size limits configured
- [ ] Running as non-root user
- [ ] Network isolation implemented
- [ ] Firewall rules in place
- [ ] Logging configured
- [ ] Monitoring enabled
- [ ] Resource limits set
- [ ] BPF filters restrictive
- [ ] Destination validated
- [ ] Access controls implemented

## Incident Response

### Detection
1. Monitor logs for anomalies
2. Track metrics for unusual patterns
3. Alert on security events

### Response
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Preserve logs for analysis
3. Apply rate limiting if under attack
4. Update filters to block malicious traffic

### Recovery

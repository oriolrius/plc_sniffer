# PLC Sniffer - Repository Analysis and Improvement Guide

## Project Overview

The PLC Sniffer is a Python-based network packet capture tool designed to monitor UDP traffic from Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and forward the captured payloads to a specified destination. The project uses Scapy for packet capture and is containerized using Docker.

## Current Repository Structure

```
plc_sniffer/
├── plc_sniffer.py          # Main application (single file)
├── pyproject.toml          # Python project configuration (version: 0.1.0)
├── setup.py                # Legacy Python packaging
├── uv.lock                 # UV package manager lock file
├── Dockerfile              # Container definition
├── compose.yaml            # Docker Compose configuration
├── README.md               # Basic user documentation
├── .gitignore              # Git ignore rules
└── .claude/                # Claude-specific documentation
    └── README.md           # This file
```

## Version Management

**IMPORTANT**: The project version is maintained in `pyproject.toml`. When making any changes to the project, especially in the `.claude/` directory, you must increment the build number in the version field. Current version: `0.1.0`

## Repository Organization Improvement Plan

### 1. **Implement Proper Project Structure**

Transform from single-file to modular architecture:

```
plc_sniffer/
├── src/
│   └── plc_sniffer/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── main.py           # Entry point
│       ├── config.py         # Configuration management
│       ├── sniffer.py        # Core packet capture logic
│       ├── forwarder.py      # Packet forwarding logic
│       └── utils.py          # Utility functions
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/
│   ├── integration/
│   └── conftest.py
├── scripts/
│   └── entrypoint.sh         # Docker entrypoint
├── docs/
│   ├── architecture.md
│   ├── configuration.md
│   └── security.md
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       ├── ci.yml
│       └── security.yml
└── requirements/
    ├── base.txt
    ├── dev.txt
    └── test.txt
```

### 2. **Add Development Infrastructure**

Create essential development files:

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Automated code quality checks
- `Makefile` - Common development tasks
- `tox.ini` - Test automation across Python versions
- `.editorconfig` - Consistent code formatting
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `SECURITY.md` - Security policies

### 3. **Implement CI/CD Pipeline**

GitHub Actions workflows for:
- Automated testing on PR
- Security scanning (SAST/dependency checks)
- Docker image building and scanning
- Release automation with version tagging

## Three Major Improvements Required

### 1. **Security Hardening** (Critical Priority)

**Current Issues:**
- Runs as root in Docker container
- No input validation or sanitization
- No authentication/authorization
- Potential for amplification attacks
- Requires privileged container mode

**Required Actions:**
- Implement input validation for all configuration
- Add rate limiting and packet size limits
- Create non-root user for container execution
- Add authentication for packet forwarding
- Implement security logging and monitoring
- Consider using capabilities instead of privileged mode

### 2. **Code Quality and Testing** (High Priority)

**Current Issues:**
- No tests whatsoever
- Global variables reduce testability
- Generic exception handling masks issues
- Unused imports and variables
- No type hints or documentation
- Single-threaded design limits performance

**Required Actions:**
- Add comprehensive unit tests (target 80% coverage)
- Implement integration tests for packet capture
- Add type hints throughout the codebase
- Set up linting (flake8, pylint, black, mypy)
- Refactor to class-based design
- Remove all unused code
- Add proper error handling with specific exceptions
- Implement async/threading for better performance

### 3. **Operational Readiness** (High Priority)

**Current Issues:**
- No health checks or monitoring
- No metrics or observability
- No graceful shutdown handling
- Missing operational documentation
- No log rotation or management
- No deployment guides

**Required Actions:**
- Add health check endpoint
- Implement Prometheus metrics
- Add structured logging with correlation IDs
- Create operational runbooks
- Implement graceful shutdown on signals
- Add configuration validation on startup
- Create deployment guides for different environments
- Add alerting configurations

## Quick Start for Improvements

1. **Immediate Actions** (Do these first):
   ```bash
   # Add pre-commit hooks
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   
   # Add basic tests
   mkdir -p tests/unit
   # Create test_sniffer.py with basic tests
   
   # Add type hints
   pip install mypy
   # Add type annotations to plc_sniffer.py
   ```

2. **Security Fixes** (Within first week):
   - Add input validation
   - Create Dockerfile.secure with non-root user
   - Implement rate limiting

3. **Long-term Improvements** (Within first month):
   - Refactor to modular architecture
   - Implement comprehensive testing
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Development Guidelines

1. Always increment the version in `pyproject.toml` when making changes
2. Run tests before committing: `pytest tests/`
3. Ensure linting passes: `make lint`
4. Update documentation for any API changes
5. Follow semantic versioning for releases

## Security Considerations

This tool captures network traffic and requires careful security considerations:

1. **Deployment Security**:
   - Deploy only in isolated network segments
   - Use firewall rules to restrict access
   - Enable audit logging
   - Regular security scanning

2. **Operational Security**:
   - Monitor for unusual traffic patterns
   - Implement alerting for errors
   - Regular security updates
   - Access control for configuration

3. **Data Security**:
   - Consider encryption for forwarded packets
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Audit data access
   - Compliance with data protection regulations

## Maintenance Notes

- The project uses Alpine Linux for minimal container size
- Scapy requires libpcap for packet capture
- Python 3.8+ is required for compatibility
- Consider migrating to Python 3.12 for performance improvements
